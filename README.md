# Raytracer project for a Northeastern Computer Graphics Course

Based on the popular "Ray Tracing in One Weekend" tutorial series. 

## Features several homemade additions, such as...
* An entire 3 Item Vector class, [vec3](https://github.com/avp55/Raytracer/blob/master/include/vec3.h), providing all the expected and necessary Vector operations (Addition, Sub, Mult, Scale, Dot, etc)
* A custom [PPM Loader](https://github.com/avp55/Raytracer/blob/master/include/ppmLoader.h) to load in PPM Files.
* A Custom [OBJ Loader](https://github.com/avp55/Raytracer/blob/master/include/OBJ.h) to load in OBJ Files.
* [Collision rules for Triangles](https://github.com/avp55/Raytracer/blob/master/include/triangleCanHit.h), allowing complex shapes to be raytraced
